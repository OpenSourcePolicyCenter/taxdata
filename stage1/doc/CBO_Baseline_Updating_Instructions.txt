This document provides instructions for updating the 'CBO_baseline.csv' file
found in the Stage I folder.

Most of the projections can be found in the CBO's 10-year Economic Projections.
Those variables are listed under "Variables in 10-Year CBO Projections." Those
not in that file are listed separately with instructions on where/how to
find/update them.

The year of the file/report the current numbers come from as well as the year
of the file/report used before the most recent update are listed for each
variable. These will need to be updated with each update of CBO_baseline.

If the updates include projections for years that were not there previously,
'Stage I.py' and 'CLP_solver_16Years.py' will also need to be updated.
Instructions for that are also included in this file.

        Notes: This projection is not in every iteration of this document,
               but is the only publicly available projection I could find.
               In the revenue projections file, the data is in the 'Capital
               Gains Realizations' tab under the 'Capital Gains Realizations'
               column.

        Instructions:
            - Look at the medical care component of CPI-Urban Consumers
            - Take the 12 month average for each year in the data
            - Find the average difference between CPI-U and CPI-Medical Care
              (medical care should be higher)
            - Add this average difference to the CBO CPI-U projections

        Notes: Put the 'Total Benefits' number from the table in terms of
               billions rather than millions of dollars.

Updating Stage I.py:

    Increase the final year in the for loop to be one greater than the last
    year in the updated CBO_baseline file.

Updating CLP_solver_16Year.py:

    Increase the length of the 'z' array to be equal to the new number of years
    being calculated.
    Add elements to that array that match these new years in the same format
    as all other years are in.
    Add new weight columns to 'z' DataFrame.
