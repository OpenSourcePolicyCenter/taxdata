#### Stage III Documentation
#### February 2017

Stage I and Stage II of OSPCâ€™s extrapolation procedure blow up and
re-weight each variable in the PUF-CPS matched data file (PUF) in
order to match macroeconomic projections of growth rates and aggregate
totals. Stage I determines per capita grow (or "blowup") factors using
both macro targets and population growth rates. In Stage II, a linear
programming algorithm is applied in order to adjust the weight given
to each record so that all targeted variables will sum up to their
respective targets, while non-targeted variables also stay in
reasonable ranges.

While Stage II does target wage distribution, only the aggregate
totals for all other income variables are targeted and the resulting
distributions of those variables can be inconsistent with what
publicly available tax data shows. Stage III fixes this error by
applying an adjustment factor to each record in the PUF based on the
level of AGI in the PUF. The factor is calculated so that the
aggregate value of the variable targeted does not change, but the
distribution more accurately reflects the data.

### Procedure

For the targeted variable, Stage III uses information from [SOI Tax
Stats](https://www.irs.gov/uac/soi-tax-stats-individual-statistical-tables-by-size-of-adjusted-gross-income)
tables to determine what percent of its total is in each AGI bin for
2009-2014 (see appendix for the bin breakdown). The distribution is
assumed to hold at 2014 levels for the years 2015-2026. These are the
goal distributions.

For each year adjustment factors are needed, the targeted variable is
extrapolated to that year using the same routine as in
Tax-Calculator. The goal bin amounts are then found using the goal
distributions and aggregate total found in the PUF.

The goal bin amounts are divided by the actual bin amounts, which are
calculated using the AGI variable found in the PUF before final
processing, in order to find a set of adjustment factors that can be
multiplied by each record in each AGI bin so that bin totals reach
their targeted levels.

While this process does benefit from its simplicity, there are some
trade-offs:

* Because AGI bin is determined using 2009 AGI levels, it does not
account for any change in AGI overtime that could result in a tax unit
moving into a different AGI bin. Thus, the final distribution will not
be identical to what is found in IRS tax data.

* Because the factor is only being applied to one element of income,
any possible relationship between two types of income will be
lost. However, in the case of interest income, there do not appear to
be any strong correlations with other income items (see appendix).

### Results 
Despite relying on AGI level found in the original PUF rather than
recalculating AGI each year to account for growth as Tax-Calc does,
the final distribution when including the adjustment is much more
representative of the distribution found in SOI data, as seen in
figure A.

### Tax-Calculator Implementation
Running `stage3.py` in the `stage3` directory will output a file
called `puf_ratios.csv`. This file is placed in the `taxcalc`
directory within the larger Tax-Calculator package. To apply the
proper adjustment factor, Tax-Calc uses the variable `agi_bin` in
`puf.csv`. This variable is added during the final preparation of
`puf.csv` and is between 0 and 18 for each tax unit dependent on which
AGI bin they fall in. Tax-Calculator reads in `puf_ratios.csv` in the
Records class and applies the adjustment factors based on the value of
`agi_bin` for each tax unit.
