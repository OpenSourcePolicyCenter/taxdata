About taxdata
=============

This repository prepares data used in the [Tax-Calculator
repository](https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator).

The data files produced here, all of which have CSV format, provide
two different sets of data files for Tax-Calculator:

- A set based on a recent **IRS-SOI Public Use File (PUF)**

- A set based on recent **Census Current Population Survey (CPS)** data
